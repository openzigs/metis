/**
 * #612 — close every open socket of a user who has lost access (SCIM
 * deprovision or `active: false`).
 *
 * Revoking refresh tokens stops new sessions but touches no open socket, and a
 * socket keeps every room it joined — MCP workspace status rooms included —
 * until it disconnects. `disconnectSockets(true)` closes the underlying
 * connection for every socket in the user's personal `user:{id}` room (joined
 * on connect from the verified JWT), through the adapter, so it reaches every
 * node of a multi-node deployment. With no registered server (tests, scripts)
 * it is a no-op.
 *
 * Called after the database write has committed, so it is best-effort: an
 * adapter error is logged, never thrown, so the route cannot answer 500 for a
 * change that already landed.
